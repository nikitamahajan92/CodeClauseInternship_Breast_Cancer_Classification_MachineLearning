# CodeClauseInternship_Breast_Cancer_Classification_MachineLearning
This repository provides a comprehensive comparison of popular machine learning classifiers for a classification task. We evaluate the performance of LogisticRegression, XGBClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and SVM on a given dataset to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

# Introduction
Choosing the right classifier for a specific problem is crucial for achieving optimal performance. In this project, we compare the performance of four popular classifiers to help guide the selection process for similar classification tasks.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this comparison can be downloaded from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) Dataset Source. It contains relevant features and target labels for the classification task. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

# Classifiers
The following classifiers are compared in this project:

* Logistic Regression
* XGBoost Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
